Piedit is a Graphical IDE and integrated interpreter for the Piet programming language http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html.

Piet is an esoteric programming language inspired by Piet Mondrian - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian, where the programs look like abstract art. The colours and arrangement of the pixels control the program flow and operation. For a more detailed explanation, see the Piet Homepage (link above).
